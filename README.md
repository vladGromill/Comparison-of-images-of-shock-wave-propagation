# Shock Wave and Thermals Simulation in a Virtual Wind Tunnel with Maching Learning (CV)

This repository contains my scientific work related to the modeling of **shock waves** and **thermals** (mushroom-shaped structures) in a virtual aerodynamic wind tunnel. The project involves the implementation of a numerical method to solve a two-dimensional problem, simulating the behavior of matter inside the wind tunnel.

## Project Overview

### Goal
The primary goal of this project is to **reconstruct the initial parameters** of a real-world experiment conducted in the wind tunnel at the Physics Department of Moscow State University. Experimental snapshots of wave propagation and thermals development are available, but the initial conditions of the experiment are unknown. By generating similar images (graphs) using a numerical method, we aim to find the closest matches to the experimental images. This will allow us to approximate the initial parameters of the real experiment with a certain degree of accuracy.

### Methodology
1. **Numerical Algorithm**:
   - A numerical algorithm was developed in **C** (primarily written by my scientific supervisor).
   - The algorithm outputs files of type `fld.dat`, which describe the main physical quantities at each grid node.

2. **Python Visualization**:
   - I wrote a **Python** script to process these `fld.dat` files and generate wave distribution graphs (e.g., gradient density magnitude) that closely resemble the experimental images.
   - To create a diverse dataset, a large number of such images were generated.
   - An even number of pictures were also generated - a pair: an ordinary picture and a picture with a certain Gaussian noise superimposed on it. I will describe the motivation for adding noise below.

3. **Integration**:
   - The Python visualization code was integrated into the C code using a **subprocess** that calls the Python script and deletes the current `fld.dat` file after processing.
   - This sequential approach avoids memory overflow, as generating and storing 100,000+ `fld.dat` files would require over **400 GB** of storage, which exceeds the capacity of my computer.

4. **Dataset Augmentation**:
   - The dataset was augmented by stretching **40%** of the images along the X-axis to increase variability.
   - Augmentation is needed to increase the generalizing ability of the neural network, as well as so that the neural network can work with images of non-fixed size.
   - The result is about 80,000 pairs of images.
     
5. **A Neural Network for Noise Removal**

During the work, it was observed that experimental images from the real wind tunnel contain characteristic noise, whereas numerically generated images are noise-free. To address this discrepancy, a neural network was developed to denoise the experimental images, thereby improving subsequent image comparison metrics.

- **Base Architecture:**  
  The network is built upon the classic U-Net architecture, widely used for image-to-image tasks. However, to process images of varying sizes and to preserve fine details such as thin wave fronts, the architecture was adapted with an attention gate mechanism. This enhancement allows the network to focus on relevant regions and prevents the excessive blurring of delicate structures.

- **Dataset:**  
  A paired dataset of clean and noisy images was generated. In addition to the original pairs, data augmentation was performed by applying random horizontal stretching to the images, increasing the dataset size by 30â€“40%. In total, approximately 127,000 images were created.

- **Training Details:**  
  The adaptive U-Net with attention gates was trained for 5 epochs. Detailed training results and loss metrics are documented in the accompanying Jupyter Notebook. Ultimately, the network successfully learned to remove the characteristic noise, enabling more effective subsequent analysis of the images.

- **Outcome and Future Work:**  
  The denoised images significantly improve the quality of further image analysis. Future work will explore extended training on larger datasets and additional refinements in the attention mechanism to further enhance performance.

6. **Comparison of Processed and Numerical Images**

To further evaluate the effectiveness of the denoising network described in Section 5, a dedicated image comparison framework was developed. The idea is to first denoise the experimental images using the neural network from Section 5 and then compare these processed images with numerically generated images. Instead of performing pixel-level comparisons, the approach extracts numerical feature vectors from the images and compares these vectors for similarity.

- **Feature Extraction Network:**  
  A pre-trained ResNet50 network was chosen as the base for feature extraction. To better capture the patterns specific to wave propagation in the wind tunnel, several of its final layers were fine-tuned on our numerically generated images. This adaptation allows the network to generate discriminative feature vectors that effectively represent the key characteristics of the images.

- **Comparison Methodology:**  
  Once feature vectors are extracted from both the denoised experimental images and the numerical images, similarity metrics (such as cosine similarity or Euclidean distance) are employed to quantify the resemblance between them. This high-level comparison is more robust to minor variations in image appearance, focusing instead on the underlying physical patterns.

- **Outcome and Future Directions:**  
  The implemented framework has shown promising results in identifying numerical images that closely match the processed experimental ones. Future work will explore further refinements of the feature extraction process and investigate alternative similarity measures to enhance the accuracy and robustness of the comparisons.
